About

This project is a Pure* CSS Connect Four, made with JADE & SASS.

Pure ?

The cake is a lie ! Unfortunately, I have not been able to do it without a litte piece of javascript. 
I just used JS for one only thing : to know the current turn. I count the numbers of slots checked : if it's odd, the #1 player plays. Its it's even, it's the #2 player's turn.

Otherwise, all the other features of this game are pure CSS : the generation of the grid, the cursor behavior, the victory conditions, etc...
